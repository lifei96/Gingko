The mayor told the South Bend Tribune, “I’m focused on how we can work together across city limits and across the aisle.”</p><p class="">“With respect to Pence’s worst blunder, his most difficult controversy, Mayor Pete was not leading the charge against him,” said Robert Dion, a political science professor at the University of Evansville in southern Indiana. “If you’re a Democratic mayor in a Republican state and you rely on friendly relations with the General Assembly, you don’t necessarily want to be lobbing bombs all the time. But that should not preclude someone from speaking out forcefully on a pressing civil rights issue.”</p><p class="">Buttigieg publicly came out as gay about three months after Pence signed the “religious freedom” law.
